# react-native-rough
Animated [**Rough.js**](https://roughjs.com/) bindings for that hand-drawn feel.

## getting started

[react-native-rough](https://github.com/cawfree/react-native-rough) is available via the [**npm registry**](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```
yarn add react-native-rough # or npm i -s react-native-rough
```

This project depends upon [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg), and it assumes it has been installed and linked to the target project.

The component property spec fully conforms to the [**Rough.js API Specification**](https://github.com/pshihn/rough/wiki), and is powered by the [**Animated Driver**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated).

You can see this library in action in the [**Example App**](./example/App.js).
